# RigMirror

## Description

`RigMirror` is a basic application designed to synchronize the tuned frequency of one radio (the primary radio) with a second radio (the secondary radio). This can be particularly useful if you want to compare the reception quality of two radios on the same or separate antennas, or if you're testing various antennas while monitoring their reception simultaneously on two different radios or SDRs.
